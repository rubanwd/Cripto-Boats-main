- Manually control Take-Profit and Stop-Loss levels
- Open multiple strategic positions across different assets
- Benefit from risk diversification through position spreading
- Offset potential losses with gains from other positions

## Technical Details 🔧

### AI Models Used
1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
   - Specialized neural network for time series prediction
   - Capable of learning long-term dependencies
   - Optimized for cryptocurrency price movement patterns
   - Uses multiple technical indicators for enhanced accuracy

![LSTM](https://github.com/Solrikk/Small-Boats/blob/main/assets/photo/41598_2019_55861_Fig1_HTML.png)

2. **Random Forest**
   - Ensemble learning algorithm
   - Combines multiple decision trees
   - Reduces overfitting through aggregation
   - Provides robust market trend predictions

### Technical Indicators
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Bollinger Bands
- Ichimoku Cloud
- VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
- ATR (Average True Range)

## Performance Features 🎯

## Installation & Setup 🛠️

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- GPU recommended for faster model training
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- Bybit account with API access

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Initialize Project:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Solrikk/CryptoBoat.git
cd CryptoBoat
```

2. **Install Required Packages:**
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow scikit-learn ta ccxt matplotlib
```

3. **Configure Exchange:**
Update `main.py` with your Bybit API credentials:
```python
API_KEY = "your_api_key"    # From Bybit dashboard
API_SECRET = "your_api_secret"
```

4. **Configure Risk Parameters:**
In `main.py`, adjust trading parameters:
```python
risk_percentage = 0.3  # Risk per trade (0.3%)
TRADE_COOLDOWN = 60   # Seconds between trades
```

### Running the Bot

1. **Initial Launch:**
```bash
python main.py
```

2. **Monitor Operations:**
- Check `trading_bot_derivatives.log` for real-time status
- Review `trades_log.json` for trade history

### System Architecture

```
Input Data → Feature Engineering → Model Prediction → Trading Logic
    ↓              ↓                    ↓               ↓
OHLCV Data → Technical Indicators → LSTM + RF → Position Management
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Log files track all operations
- Real-time balance updates
- Trade execution confirmations
- Error handling and reporting

### Risk Management
- Position sizing based on account balance
- Maximum risk per trade: 0.3%
- Trade cooldown period: 60 seconds
- Automatic error recovery
- Multiple validation layers

### Error Handling
- Network disconnect protection
- API error recovery
- Invalid data detection
- Balance verification
- Order validation

## Usage Guide 📚

1. Start the Bot:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Monitor the Logs:
- Check `trading_bot_derivatives.log` for detailed operation logs
- Review trade history in `trades_log.json`

3. Configure Risk Parameters:
- Adjust position sizes in `calculate_position_size()`
- Modify risk percentage (default: 0.3%)
- Set custom stop-loss levels

⚠️ **Remember**: Past performance does not guarantee future results. Always trade responsibly and within your risk tolerance.
